# This defines progmem strings for the firmware
#
# Use ./scripts/build_text.py to build this into text.h and text.c
#
# This is generated from YAML as progmem strings have to be defined and declared
# separately in a header and source file to prevent duplicate strings in program
# memory for each file that uses one of these progmem variables. It's tedious to
# manage those two files manually (since they share a lot of content), so the
# files are generated using Python instead.
#
# Key names are used as variable names, so must be valid C99 variable names. Values
# are escaped and wrapped in quotes unless they start with a double quote.
#
# Strings that start with a literal double quote (") will be put in the generated
# files verbatim. This allows for use of pre-processor macros/defines in strings.
